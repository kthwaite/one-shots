### hex-to-oklch.html

This standalone HTML file implements a web-based tool that converts hexadecimal color codes into their corresponding OKLCH color format. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can:

- Enter a JSON object mapping color names to hex values.
- Convert the hex values to OKLCH using inline JavaScript functions.
- Preview the colors via dynamic swatches.
- Generate and copy the resulting CSS variables formatted with OKLCH values.

### Cursor Rotate Card Demo

This standalone file provides an interactive demo showcasing 3D card rotation effects based on cursor movement. It includes:

- Two card elements (one with standard sensitivity, one with enhanced sensitivity) that rotate in 3D as the user hovers over them.
- CSS styles defining the card appearance, transitions, box shadows, and the overall layout.
- JavaScript logic that calculates the cursor position relative to each card to dynamically adjust rotation and shadow effects.
- Slider controls that let users adjust parameters such as the perspective depth and rotation sensitivity for each card in real time.
